<H1>Other Transana Functions</H1><HR>

<H2>Adjust Indices</H2>
<P>Adjust Indices, located in the Document menu, allows you to alter all <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> in an editable <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcript</A> by a constant amount.  This is helpful when you want to use an existing time-coded Transcript for a new media file that may not start at precisely the same time.<P>

<H2>Auto-Arrange</H2>
<P>The Auto-Arrange option, in the Options menu, determines whether user changes in the size and position of one Transana window cause automatic changes in the size or position of the other Transana windows.  If you have a dual-monitor setup, it can be very nice to turn Auto-Arrange off, move the <A HREF="documentwindow.htm">Document Window</A> or <A HREF="mediawindow.htm">Media Window</A> to your second monitor, and re-size and re-arrange your other Transana windows.<P>

<H2>Auto Word-Tracking</H2>
<P>The Auto Word-Tracking option is located in the Options menu. When it is checked, the <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcript</A> will be highlighted as the media file plays. You must have <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> in your <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcript</A> for this to work, and the <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcript</A> must not be in &quot;Edit&quot; mode.<P>

<H2>Bring Main Windows to Front</H2>
Located in the Window menu, the &quot;Bring Main Windows to Front&quot; item bring Transana's <A HREF="documentwindow.htm">Document</A>, <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data</A>, <A HREF="mediawindow.htm">Media</A>, and <A HREF="visualizationwindow.htm">Visualization</A> windows to the front, over any windows from Transana's Snapshots, Reports, or other applications.<P>
                                                                  
<H2>Change/Create Database</H2><P>
Transana supports the creation and use of multiple, separate databases.  To change from one database to another, select &quot;Change Database&quot; from the &quot;File&quot; Menu.  If you want to create a new database, simply type in the name of a database that does not exist, and Transana will prompt you about creating it.  (Multi-user Transana users will need to talk to their Database Manager about creating new databases.)<P>

<H2>Change Document Splitter Orientation</H2>
Transana can display <A HREF="documentproperties.htm">Documents</A> side-by-side to allow comparison, and can display <A HREF="multitrans.htm">multiple simultaneous Transcripts</A> for the same media files.  By default, multiple Documents and Transcripts are shown in horizontal panes within the <A HREF="documentwindow.htm">Document Window</A>.  If you would rather have these Documents and Transcripts displayed in vertical panes, go to the &quot;Document&quot; menu and select &quot;Change Document Splitter Orientation&quot;.<P>

<H2>Chat Window</H2>
The Multi-user version of Transana is designed to facilitate collaboration.  The Chat Window, available in the &quot;Tools&quot; menu, is a simple text chat utility designed to allow researchers connected to the same database at the same time to communicate with each other via text chat.  All connected users will be listed on the right side of screen.  To chat privately, select names in that list; otherwise all users will see your messages.<P>

<H2>Display Monitor</H2>
On dual-monitor computers, this setting in the &quot;Options&quot; menu allows you to select which monitor will display Transana.<P>

<H2>Export Clip Video</H2><P>
When you create a <A HREF="clipproperties.htm">Clip</A> in Transana, what you create is a virtual Clip rather than an actual video file.  However, it is occasionally useful to be able to export the media for a Clip as a separate video or audio file.  To do this, right-click the Clip and choose "Export Clip Video".  This should be done sparingly, as video files use up lots of hard drive space.<P>

Please note that the Standard version of Transana does not support exporting Clip Video.  To use this feature, you must be using the Professionsal, Computer Lab, or Multi-User version of Transana.<P> 

<H2>Fixed-Increment Time Codes</H2><P>
This function allows you to have Transana insert time codes at regularly spaced time intervals in a blank <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcript</A>.  Create a new <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcript</A> and put that Transcript in Edit mode.  Then go to the Document menu and select Fixed-Increment Time Codes.  You will be prompted for the desired time increment.  Enter the number of seconds you want between time codes.<P>

You will notice that you will need to adjust your transcription style after using this function.  You will need to use left-clicking to position in a time-coded segment of the Transcript followed by right-clicking (Ctrl-clicking on the Mac with a single-button mouse) the Transcript so that just the section of your media file that falls between consecutive time codes is played.  Otherwise, it's difficult to keep the time codes positioned correctly relative to the Transcript text.<P>

<H2>Insert Clip Hyperlink</H2>
<H2>Insert Note Hyperlink</H2>
<H2>Insert Quote Hyperlink</H2>
<H2>Insert Snapshot Hyperlink</H2>
<P>This function allows you to insert a hyperlink to a <A HREF="quoteproperties.htm">Quote</A>, <A HREF="clipproperties.htm">Clip</A>, <A HREF="snapshotproperties.htm">Snapshot</A>, or <A HREF="noteproperties.htm">Note</A> into a <A HREF="documentproperties.htm">Document</A> or <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcript</A>.  This is particularly useful when writing <A HREF="editdocument.htm">Research Journals</A>.</P>

<P>Please note that Hyperlinks are not automatically removed from Documents and Transcripts when the linked Quotes, Clips, Snapshots, or Notes are deleted.  Please also note that inserting a Snapshot Hyperlink is different from <A HREF="InsertSnapshot.htm">inserting a Snapshot</A>> into a Document or Transcript.  Inserting a hyperlink give you only the link.  Inserting a Snapshot gives you both the coded image and the hyperlink.</P>

<H2>Load Snapshot Context</H2>
<P>When a <A HREF="snapshotproperties.htm">Snapshot</A> is associated with a specific position in an <A HREF="episodeproperties.htm">Episode</A> and <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcript</A>, you can load that position in the media file by right-clicking the <A HREF="snapshotproperties.htm">Snapshot</A> in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Database Tree</A> and selecting &quot;Load Snapshot Context&quot; in the popup menu.</P>

<H2>Locate Quote in Document</H2>
There are times when it is desirable to be able to move from a <A HREF="quoteproperties.htm">Quote</A> back to the <A HREF="documentproperties.htm">Document</A> it was created from.  For example, you may want to look at what occurs immediately before or after a Quote, or you may want to create a similar Quote with different start or end points.  To move from a Quote back to the original Document, right-click the Quote on the Database tab in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data window</A> and select &quot;Locate Quote in Document.&quot;  <P>

<H2>Locate Clip in Episode</H2><P>
There are times when it is desirable to be able to move from a <A HREF="clipproperties.htm">Clip</A> back to the <A HREF="episodeproperties.htm">Episode</A> it was created from.  For example, you may want to look at what occurs immediately before or after a Clip, or you may want to create a similar Clip with different start or end points.  To move from a Clip back to the original Episode, right-click the Clip on the Database tab in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data window</A> and select &quot;Locate Clip in Episode.&quot;  Please note that if the time codes associated with a clip are deleted in the originating Transcript, this function may not work properly.<P>

<H2>Long Document Editing</H2>
Due to a bug in one of Transana's programming components, editing long <A HREF="documentproperties.htm">Documents</A> and <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcripts</A> can become slow.  The more of your Document or Transcript follows the current editing position, the slower the program becomes.<P>

To work around this difficulty, go to the &quot;Options&quot; menu and select &quot;Long Document Editing&quot;.  This causes Transana to load only a segment of your active Document or Transcript when you go into Edit mode instead of the whole thing.  This solves the problem.  However, if you want to move to a different section of the document (moving more than about 200 paragraphs), you will want to leave Edit mode, move your cursor, and re-enter Edit mode.<P>

<H2>Media Size</H2><P>
In the Options menu, the Media Size sub-menu allows you to change the size of the Media window and have all other Transana windows compensate automatically.<P>

<H2>Record Lock Utility</H2>
The Multi-user version of Transana avoids problems with data conflicts between users by locking records when they are being edited.  If Transana crashes while a user has one or more records locked, problems can arise.  If you find that a record you need is locked by another user who is not currently logged into your database with Transana, you can go to the &quot;Tools&quot; menu and select the &quot;Record Lock Utility&quot;.  This utility assessed whether records can safely be unlocked and provides a mechanism to unlock those records that can be unlocked safely.<P>

<H2>Play All Clips in a Collection</H2><P>
There are some circumstances when it is helpful to be able to review all <A HREF="clipproperties.htm">Clips</A> in a <A HREF="collectionproperties.htm">Collection</A> in sequence.  To do this, right-click the Collection and select the &quot;Play All Clips&quot; option.  Clips will be played in the order they are displayed in the Database tab in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data Window</A>.  To change the order in which Clips are played, simply cut-and-paste (or drag-and-drop) the Clips within the Collection  so that they are displayed in the desired order.  Play All Clips will play Clips from nested Collections automatically, but you can stop this by pressing the "Cancel" button.<P>

<H2>Presentation Mode</H2><P>
Presentation Mode, selected in the &quot;Options&quot; Menu, offers four choices that affect the way Transana presents video during playback.  &quot;All Windows,&quot; the default setting, shows all Transana windows during video playback.  &quot;Video Only&quot; displays the video window full screen when the video is playing.  &quot;Video and Transcript Only&quot; displays the video in the top 65% of the screen and displays the <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcript</A>, with scrolling highlight if Auto Word-tracking is enabled, in the bottom 35% of the screen.  &quot;Audio and Transcript Only&quot; hides the video during playback, showing the Transcript full screen and playing only the audio portion of the media file.<P>

<H2>Print a Transcript</H2><P>
The option allowing you to print the currently-loaded transcript is located in the Document Menu as well as the more traditional location of the File menu.<P>

<H2>Quick Quote and Clip Mode</H2>
<P>If &quot;Quick Clip Mode&quot; is checked in the &quot;Options&quot; menu, dragging a <A HREF="keywordproperties.htm">Keyword</A> and dropping it on a <A HREF="documentproperties.htm">Document</A> or <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcript</A> triggers the creation of a <A HREF="quickquotes.htm">Quick Quote</A> or <A HREF="quickclips.htm">Quick Clip</A>.  If &quot;Quick Clip Mode&quot; is not checked, dragging a <A HREF="keywordproperties.htm">Keyword</A> and dropping it on the <A HREF="documentwindow.htm">Document window</A> applies that keyword to the currently-loaded <A HREF="documentproperties.htm">Document</A>, <A HREF="episodeproperties.htm">Episode</A>, <A HREF="quoteproperties.htm">Quote</A>, or <A HREF="clipproperties.htm">Clip</A>.</P>

<H2>Show Quick Quote and Clip Warning</H2>
<P>When <A HREF="quickquotes.htm">Quick Quote</A> or <A HREF="quickclips.htm">Quick Clip</A> creation is triggered for a segment of a <A HREF="documentproperties.htm">Document</A> or <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcript</A> that has already been used for a Quick Quote or Quick Clip, Transana will display a warning message about the duplication if this option is selected.  Some researchers intentionally multi-code their Quick Quotes and Quick Clips and do not want such a warning slowing Quick Quote and Quick Clip creation down, while other researchers seek to code each Quote or Clip only once and find this warning very helpful.</P>

<H2>Text Time Code Conversion</H2>
<P>If you import a <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcript</A> into Transana that was created in another transcription program, it might have time code information in HH:MM:SS.hh format.  If you have not inserted any Transana <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> into the Transcript, you can use &quot;Text Time Code Conversion&quot;, in the &quot;Document&quot; menu, to convert the text format time codes into Transana <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A>.  Please note that Transana time codes MUST be in linear order from the beginning to the end of the Transcript, and Transana does not support duplicate time codes.  Any text time codes that do not conform to this will be left un-converted.</P>

<H2>Update Database Window</H2>
You shouldn't even need this, but if your <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data window</A> becomes corrupted, you can right-click (Ctrl-Click on OS X) the root database node in the Database Tree and select &quot;Update Database Window&quot;.  This will re-load your Database Tree from the database.<P>
