<H2><I>Creating a Library</I><HR></H2>

Before you can enter text or media data into Transana, you must create a Library in which to place that data.  <B>A Library is simply a group of related source data files</B>.  In small studies, there may only be one Library named for the study.  However, having such categories can be very important for more complex studies with large numbers of data files that fall into different groupings.  The Library is primarily intended to make it easier for you to find a particular source file.<P>

As a general rule, the Library name should reflect the most salient thing about the source data files that will be grouped together.  You can always rename your Library records and reorganize your Document and Episode records within them if you want to.  How you organize your source data files is independent of how you organize your analytic data later in the analytic process.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions (Macintosh single-button mouse users, remember that Control-click emulates right-click):<P>

1. To create a Library, right-click the Library node in the database tree and choose <B>Add Library</B> from the pop-up menu.  You see the following dialog box:<P>

<IMG SRC="images/libraryproperties.gif"  BORDER=0><P>

2. Enter <B>Demonstration Data</B> as the Library ID.  Enter your name or initials as the Owner, and select <B>Tutorial</B> as the Default Keyword Group in the list.  Click OK to close the dialog box and save the record to the database.  Your Library should now appear in the database tree.<P>

3. We have just made our first important analytic decision by choosing what to call our Library.  Let's create an analytic memo to document this analytic step.  To do this, right-click the <B>Demonstration Data</B> Library and choose <B>Add Library Note</B>.<P>

4. The function of this analytic memo is to document the reasoning behind the creation of our first Library.  We can reflect that in our Note ID.  Name the note <B>Demonstation Data Library Purpose</B> and put your name or initials under <B>Note Taker</B>.  Click OK.<P>

5. Start your analytic memo by pressing Ctrl-T on Windows or Cmd-T on OS X to get a date and time stamp to record when you wrote this particular analytic memo.  Then write a brief explanation of the thinking behind the creation of the <B>Demonstration Data</B> Library.<P>

Being very thorough with your analytic memo writing can be extremely important when it comes to writing up your analysis down the road.  It is through writing and modifying analytic memos that a qualitative researcher documents the analytic process in Transana.  It is a good practice to date and time stamp all entries in each note, and to avoid deleting content from notes.  While your thinking and understanding of your data will change as you work through your analysis, sometimes it is important to be able to recreate early ideas that you reject and the thought process that led to new ideas during the writing phases of your research.  Analytic memos, including those that indicate what ideas you rejected, can be crucial in this process.<P>

6.  Close your note when you are finished.  Transana automatically saves the changes to your note when you close the note editor.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced topic:</FONT>  In most cases, Transana doesn't care how you organize your data.  However, if you want to look for changes in coding patterns over time, (i.e. if you want to do <B><I>longitudinal qualitative analysis</I></B>,) all Documents and Episodes to be compared must be implemented in the same Library.  See <A HREF="reports.htm">Reports</A> later in the Tutorial for more information on this topic.<P>

If you are using the Professional, Multi-user, or Computer Lab versions, click on <B>Next Page</B> instead, as these versions include features not included in the Standard version of Transana.<P>
