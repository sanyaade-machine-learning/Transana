Transana does not import media files or still image files into its database.  These files are not likely to change, and tend to be quite large, so loading them into the database would be quite inefficient and would slow Transana down a lot.  As a result, Transana needs to know where you store this information.  (Text Documents and Transcripts, on the other hand, are comparatively small and are likely to be subject to revision, so Transana does import text into the project database.)<P>   

If this is the first time you have started Transana for a particular database, you should define the database's <B>Media Library Directory</B>.  A Media Library Directory is the base location where Transana should look for data files for a given database, especially media and image files.  All media and image files analyized in the same Transana database should share a common Media Library Directory or be stored in subdirectories off that directory if possible.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Windows Activity:</FONT> To set the Media Library Directory, go to the <B>Options</B> menu and select <B>Program Settings</B>.  From the <B>Directories</B> tab, set the Media Library Directory setting appropriate for your computer.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Macintosh Activity:</FONT> To set the Media Library Directory, go to the <B>Transana</B> program menu and select <B>Preferences</B>.  From the <B>Directories</B> tab, set the Media Library Directory setting appropriate for your computer.<P>

<B><I>NOTE:</I></B>  The use of the Media Library Directory is convenient in single-user Transana, but <B>is essential when using multi-user Transana</B>.  This is because it is likely that different computers in a multi-user Transana project will need to refer to the location of media and image files in different ways.  Windows computers require a drive letter, for example, while OS X does not have the drive letter concept.  Even computers using the same operating system sometimes refer to the same location on a network in different ways.  And projects that span mulitple locations need to have a copy of the media and image library in each location, which likely will have different data paths.<P> 

To handle this, each computer relies upon the Media Library Directory setting to know how to find the project's media and image files.  Transana tracks file information following the Media Library Directory, and automatically combines the individual Media Library Directory on each computer with the shared file name in the project database to create the full, correct path to each file from each computer.<P>
