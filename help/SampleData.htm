<H2><I>The Sample Data</I><HR></H2>

This tutorial describes the qualitative analysis of a sample text file, the transcription and qualitative analysis of a sample video file, and the qualitative analysis of a sample photograph.  These data files are available on the Downloads page of the Transana Web Site (http://www.transana.org).  If you have not already done so, you should download and un-zip the demonstration data now. Later in the Tutorial, you will be instructed to browse to these files, so make sure you know where to find them when you need them!  (I've saved the files in a directory called "Demonstration Data" for the Tutorial.)<P>

The content in these sample files is admittedly procedurally rather than analytically oriented.  The goal of the Tutorial is to help you gain procedural knowledge, so we will focus on process rather than analysis during the Tutorial.<P>
