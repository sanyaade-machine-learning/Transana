Please note that the Standard version of Transana does not support Documents.  To use this feature, you must be using the Professionsal, Computer Lab, or Multi-User version of Transana.<P> 

A <A HREF="organization.htm">Document</A> in Transana is where original source text data has been imported.  Once imported, Transana maintains a separate copy of this text data, so changes to the original document file do not affect the Document in Transana and changes to the Transana Document text do not affect the original imported file.<P>

To add a <A HREF="organization.htm">Document</A> in Transana, right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) a named <A HREF="libraryproperties.htm">Library</A> in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data window</A> and choose &quot;Add Document.&quot;  You will see the dialog box shown above.  The only required information is an &quot;Document ID&quot; which must be unique within the Library.  If you want to import an existing text file, select an &quot;RTF/XML/TXT File to import&quot; using the associated &quot;Browse&quot; button.  Othewise the Document will be blank and available for editing.  &quot;Author&quot; can be used to indicate the author of the text or the name of the person who imported the Document.  &quot;Comment&quot; can be used in any way you wish.  The &quot;Library ID&quot; and the &quot;Length&quot; field is filled in automatically by Transana and cannot be edited.<P>

By selecting a Keyword Group and Keyword, then clicking the <IMG SRC="images/addkw.gif"  ALT="addkw"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;button, you can add as many analytic keywords as you wish to each Document.  These Keywords are default codes, and are optionally applied to all Quotes created from the Document.  Selecting a Keyword Group : Keyword pair in the Keywords list and pressing <IMG SRC="images/delkw.gif"  ALT="delkw"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;removes a keyword from the list, and pressing <IMG SRC="images/keywordmanagementbutton.gif"  ALT="keywordmanagementbutton"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;allows you to access <A HREF="keywordmgt.htm">Keyword Management</A>, which allows you to edit your Keywords while in the middle of creating a Document.<P>
