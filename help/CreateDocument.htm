If you are using the <B>Standard</B> version of Transana, you can skip this page.  Working with text data is only supported in the <B>Professional</B>, <B>Computer Lab</B>, and <B>Multi-user</B> versions of Transana.<P>

Once you've created a Library, you can add your first Document. <B>A Document contains the text from a single text file.</B>  <P>

For the Tutorial, we will use the one of the Demonstration data files that you downloaded from the Transana Web site.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT><P>

1. To add a Document, right-click the <B>Demonstration Data</B> Library under the Libraries node in the database tree, then choose <B>Add Document</B> from the menu.  <P>

You see the following dialog box.<P>

Notice that the Library ID is already filled in, and that your Default Keyword Group and Keywords are shown.  <P>

2. Press the <B>Browse</B> button and select the "Transana with Text.rtf" file from the Demonstration Data Files.  Notice that if you leave the Document ID blank, Transana will automatically name your Document after the file you select for import.  (You are free to change this name if you wish.)<P>

3. Double-click on the <B>Document</B> Keyword to assign this Keyword to this Document.  Adding this Keyword as a <i>Document Keyword</I> will cause it to be included as a default keyword for all Quotes created from this Document.  <P>

4. Click OK. Transana adds the Document to the database tree and automatically displays it in the Document window. <P>

It's now a good idea to do a bit more analytic memoing.  No action in Transana should be considered finished until you have written about it in an analytic memo.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT>  Right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) the <B>Transana with Text</B> Document and choose "Add Document Note" from the popup menu.  Name the new Note <B>Transana with Text Document Note</B> and enter your initials as NoteTaker.  Press <B>OK</B>.<P>

Press Ctrl-T on Windows or Cmd-T on OS X to insert a date-time stamp in the note.  It's probably a good idea to record information about when and where your text data file was created or collected and how it fits into the larger study.  Also include any other information about the Document that might be relevant to the analytic process, such as initial analytic thoughts and impressions you want to remember later.  When you are done recording your analytic process information, close the Document Note.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced Topic:</FONT> If you have a large number of text files to import into a single Library, you can use the <A HREF="batchitemcreation.htm">Batch Document Creation</A> tool.<P>
