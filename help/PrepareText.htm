If you are using the <B>Standard</B> version of Transana, you can skip this page.  Working with text data is only supported in the <B>Professional</B>, <B>Computer Lab</B>, and <B>Multi-user</B> versions of Transana.<P>

Because text data can come in so many different forms and formats, you may need to prepare your text documents for import into Transana.  At this time, Transana can import text in the following formats:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=6>
<TR>
<TH>Format</TH><TH>File extension</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Rich Text Format</TD><TD>*.rtf</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Transana's XML Format</TD><TD>*.xml</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Plain Text Format<BR>(encoded using Latin-1 or UTF-8)</TD><TD>*.txt</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

The "Transana with Text.rtf" file provided in the Demonstration Data files is in Rich Text format and is fully compatible with Transana.  However, if you want to work with your own text data in Transana, it might not be in the proper format. <P>

If you have text in other formats, including Microsoft Word's *.doc or *.docx formats, you will need to convert your source data.  The easiest way to accomplish this is to load the original document in your word processor, then choose File > Save As.  You will see an option labelled "File type", "Save as type", or something similar.  Select "Rich Text Format (*.rtf)" in this field to save your text data file as a Rich Text Format document that you can import into Transana.<P>

If you have documents in Portable Document Format (*.pdf), you may find it helpful to find a file conversion program.  A simple web search should reveal many options for such conversion, many available online and for free.<P>

Transana does not currently support the import of tables in documents.  If your document contains tables, you will need to convert the table formatting to text with tabs for that data to be correctly imported into Transana.<P> 

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced topic:</FONT> If you want to transfer text-based data (Documents or Transcripts) from one copy of Transana to another, we recommend using Transana's XML format.  Although this format can only be loaded in Transana, such file loads are very fast and are less subject to subtle distortions in measurements such as margins than are other formats.<P>
